### Uses Zymo Quick-DNA Fecal/Soil Microbe Miniprep Kit

Modifications from standard protocol in **bold**

1. Add up to 1 mL of fecal sample stored in DNA Shield to BashingBead Tube.
	- Use P1000 with tip cut slightly higher with razor blade to avoid clogging.
	- Go back with regular tip as necessary to get last bit of liquid.
2. Secure BashingBead tube in vortex fitted with 2 mL tube holding assembly, vortex for 40 minutes.
3. Centrifuge the BashingBead tube at 14,000 g for 2 minutes.
4. Transfer up to 400 µL of supernatant to a III-F filter in a collection tube.
    - Avoid beads and excessive solid debris.
5. **Add 100 µL Bashing Buffer to the remaining sample in the BashingBead Tube, secure in the tube holding assembly, and vortex for another 40 minutes.**
6. **Repeat steps 3 and 4**, then centrifuge the III-F filter in a collection tube at 8,000 g for 1 minute.
7. Add 1,200 µL of Genomic Lysis Buffer to the filtrate in the collection tube from step 6. Pipette up and down to mix.
8. Transfer 800 µL of the mixture from step 7 to a IICR column in a collection tube, centrifuge at 10,000 g for 1 minute.
9. Discard the flow through from the collection tube and repeat step 8.
10. Add 200 µL DNA Pre-Wash Buffer to the IICR column in a new collection tube, centrifuge at 10,000 g for 1 minute.
11. Add 500 µL g-DNA Wash Buffer to the IICR column and centrifuge at 10,000 g for 1 minute.
12. Transfer the IICR column to a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and add 50 µL of DNA Elution Buffer to the column matrix. Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes. Centrifuge at 10,000 g for 30 seconds to elute the DNA.
13. **Transfer the eluate from step 10 back to the IICR column, incubate for 10 minutes. Centrifuge at 10,000 g for 30 seconds.**
    - **Set IICR column in prep solution collection tube while pipetting eluate back into column.**
14. Place a III-HRC filter in a clean Collection Tube and add 600 µL of prep solution, centrifuge at 8,000 g for 3 minutes.
    - Discard the flow through.
15. Transfer the eluted DNA to the III-HRC filter in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 16,000 g for 3 minutes.
16. This eluate is the final extracted DNA, discard the III-HRC filter.
