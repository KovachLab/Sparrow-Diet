# Sparrow-Diet

### Objective

The goal of this project is to characterize the diets of tidal marsh sparrows using fecal DNA metabarcoding. We aim to identify the major dietary components of Atlantic tidal marsh sparrows, assess the dietary variation within and among species, and search for evidence of niche shifting where *Ammospiza* species live in sympatry with one another.
